Collaborated with a 2-person team to design and build a prosthetic robotic hand, leveraging Muscle Sensor Technology (EMG signal) and Arduino MicroController.
Explored the concept of pulse modulation, enabling users to operate the hand using their muscle signals.
Although the project faced challenges in achieving the desired level of accuracy, it provided valuable hands-on experience in robotics, including:
Designing and integrating EMG sensors with Arduino MicroController.
Developing algorithms for signal processing and hand control.
Troubleshooting and refining the system for improved performance.
